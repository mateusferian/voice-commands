# Voice Commands
The application has voice recognition and interacts directly with the user. It is capable of talking to the person after clicking the "start" button and emitting a sound after executing a functionality, all without the need for an external API. The application has 3 functionalities, and you can add any other you want. In the example presented, I demonstrate the process of turning on the lights in a house. The page using JFrame graphically symbolizes this functionality.
